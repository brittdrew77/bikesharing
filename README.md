## 1. Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a good business proposal. I created a bike trip analysis that showed the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders, the number of bike trips for all riders and geners for each hour of each day of each week, and the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
