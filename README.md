## 1. Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a good business proposal. I created a bike trip analysis that showed the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders, the number of bike trips for all riders and geners for each hour of each day of each week, and the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week. I also included the top starting and ending locations for riders.

The first visualization displays the checkout duration for users. Most users have a trip duration of one hour or less, since we see a peak at around 20 minutes and a decline soon after. 



The second visualization shows the breakdown of the number of trips per weekday and per hour. Based on this graph, we can see that the darker areas are around 7am to 9am and 5pm to 7pm. This means that these are the most popular times for users to checkout a bike. It makes sense, because these tend to be times before people go to work and after work. Thus, it is ideal to use a bike for transportation. Also, we can see the most popular days of the week are Thursday through Sunday, the days at the end of a week. This could imply that biking is also a leisure activity for a lot of users.
